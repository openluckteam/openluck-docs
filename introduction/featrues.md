## **Features and Innovations**

OpenLuck is committed to creating an innovative Cross-Chain NFT marketplace for the community. It focuses on creative trading models and liquidity solutions developments, as well as features and innovations such as decentralization, permissionless and cross-chain interoperability.


### **1 Lucks Trading**

Lucks Trading is an innovative trading model that combines CrowdFunding & Lottery Draw.

For example, a seller sells a NFT through crowdfunding at a price of 1,000 USDC, divides it into 1,000 shares, and the unit price is 1USDC. All users can participate at the price of 1USDC, and if you buy 1 share, you will get 1 ticket. When the crowdfunding target is reached, OpenLuck will automatically and fairly draw a lucky number, the winner who holds the lucky number will get the NFT, and the seller will get the crowdfunding amount.

Here is some key information for Lucks Trading:



* Accept tokens (ETH/MATIC/BNB/BUSD/USCD/USDT), each task can select one kind of payment token.
* Support CryptoPunks, ERC721 and ERC1155 NFT standards.
* Lucky Bonus: In addition to NFTs, the winners also have the opportunity to receive 0~30% of the deal amount bonus (the ratio is set by the seller when creating the task).
* Lucky Group: Lucks Trading supports team mode, up to 10 people. If someone in the group is the winner, the group members can share the lucky dividend equally. It greatly increases social fun and the winning probability.
* Participants can get $LUCK rewards in different proportions.
* The platform will charge a 2% protocol fee.



### **2 Cross-Chain**

Sellers can use Ethereum's NFT to create Lucks Trading orders. Through public crowdfunding in the EVM-compatible chain(Polygon/BNBChain .etc), ordinary users can use small amounts of money and have the opportunity to obtain high-value NFT. In this way, we can give full play to the respective advantages of different public chains, which can not only improve the liquidity of NFT, but also attract more users.


### **3 Decentralization**

OpenLuck is a non-custodial NFT marketplace controlled by smart contracts running on EVM-compatible chains(Polygon/BNBChain .etc) . The selection of lucky numbers uses ChainLink's VRF service, which is open, transparent, and truly random, ensuring the fairness and decentralization of the gameplay. Decentralization is the continuous pursuit of OpenLuck. For more technical details, please refer to the following technical chapters.


### **4 Permissionless**
