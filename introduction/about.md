## **Problems and Solutions**

NFT is a really innovative product in the crypto world. It can be the link to the virtual world, the crypto world, and even the real world. It is very interesting that both talented artists and ordinary people can create their own NFTs and gain recognition and support from the community.

However, we also find that there are some problems about liquidity of NFT:



* Poor liquidity of NFTs and high risk for NFT holders.
* Inefficient trading model of Most Marketplace.
* The isolation of different blockchains limits the liquidity and value potential of NFTs. 
*  High gas fee and low TPS of Ethereum limits the NFT usages.

The limitation of NFTs to a single blockchain network makes it hard for users and traders on different blockchain networks to interact and trade NFTs. The interoperability of NFT is a major concern to its community as it limits them to use only the platform they are deployed on and can't communicate with another blockchain.

OpenLuck is building a Decentralized cross-chain NFT marketplace bridging the gap between the NFT ecosystem.
