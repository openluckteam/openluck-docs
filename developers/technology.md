## ** Technology**

OpenLuck is an automated and autonomous NFT marketplace built for the community. The following details are our core technical architecture selection.



* **Chains >> BNB Chain**

    BNB Chain is a smart contract-enabled high throughput blockchain that boasts low fees. And it is a community-driven, open-sourced and decentralized ecosystem. The support of its community of users, developers, validators and delegators is vital to its health.

* **Cross-Chain Protocol >> LayerZero **

    LayerZero is an Omnichain Interoperability Protocol designed for lightweight message passing across chains. LayerZero provides authentic and guaranteed message delivery with configurable trustlessness. The protocol is implemented as a set of gas-efficient, non-upgradable smart contracts.

* **API&Indexes >> TheGraph**

    The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like BNB Chain and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.

* **Oracles >> Chainlink VRF & Keeper & Price Feeds**

    Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or usability.


    Chainlink Keepers automate smart contract functions in a decentralized, cost-efficient, and highly secure manner.

* **Storage >> IPFS/Pinata**

    IPFS is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. Pinata is a pin service for NFTs file store.


    Pinata is a IPFS pin service provider, it makes NFTs file storage easy for everyone.

* **ThirdPartServices >> Moralis**

    Moralis provides managed backend for blockchain projects. Automatically syncing the balances into the database, allowing us to set up on-chain alerts, watch smart contract events, build indexes, and so much more.
