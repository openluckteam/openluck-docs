The First Web3 Cross-Chain NFT Liquidity Marketplace.

_Unlock the ultimate cross-chain liquidity of NFT_

## What is OpenLuck


OpenLuck is a decentralized Cross-Chain NFT marketplace built on the BNB Chain which is full of innovation and creativity. 

We aim to be the global and inventive marketplace where users can trade NFTs residing in various blockchains fully decentralized and with the strongest security.

Using the world's first Lucks Trading model lowers the barriers to participation, which is more friendly for users. Users only need to pay for an extremely low cost on BNB Chain and then can have the opportunity to win the valuable NFTs on Ethereum and BNB Chain.

This innovative model makes NFT trading very interesting and attracts more people to participate, which greatly improves the liquidity of NFT and activates the entire NFT trading market.

OpenLuck supports **CryptoPunks**, **ERC721** and **ERC1155** NFT standards, whether it is collectibles, digital artwork, or assets of GameFi and Metaverse, you can conduct lucky transactions here.
