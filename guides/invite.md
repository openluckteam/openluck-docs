# Invite System

Invite your friends and get rewards points.

## About

OpenLuck is a decentralized and innovative NFT marketplace, which aims to solve the problem of NFT's lack of liquidity and provide an innovative and efficient NFT marketplace for the community.

The Invite System brings our initial community together and rewards them with Rewards Points. You get points when you join, when you use an invite, and when someone you invite uses an invite.

## Rules

### Initial Points
After joining the invite system, you will receive a invite code  and an initial number of points based on your twitter account's public metrics. 

Initial Points = following_count + followers_count + tweet_count * 2.

### Invite Points
Each invite-code can be used to invite 10 people.
Your points will increase by 50% * your invite’s points. Therefore, you will receive more points for inviting a twitter influencer. Use your invites wisely!

Invite Points =  10 invitee's Initial Points * 50%.

### 2nd Degree Invite Points

Every time someone you invite shares an invite, your points will increase by 10% * the 2nd degree invite’s points.

2nd Invite Points =  100 2nd invitee's Initial Points * 10%.

## Future Rewards

In the future, members will be rewarded with REDACTED for every point they accrue. 

* More Points means more Airdrops and Rewards in the future.
* We will randomly select several lucky users to get additional surprise rewards. Therefore, all participants have the opportunity to obtain.
