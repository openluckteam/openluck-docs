**2. What are the problems with the current NFT Liquidity?**

Most of the current NFT markets have inefficient trading models, poor liquidity, and high risks for NFT holders. The isolation of different blockchains limits the liquidity and value potential of NFTs. Ethereum's high gas fees and low TPS limit the use of NFTs.

**3. Why use OpenLuck to trade NFTs?**

OpenLuck adopts the world's first Lucks Trading model, it lowers the barriers to participation, which is more friendly for users. Users only need to pay for an extremely low cost on BNB Chain and then can have the opportunity to win the valuable NFTs on Ethereum and BNB Chain.

This innovative model makes NFT trading very interesting and attracts more people to participate, which greatly improves the liquidity of NFT and activates the entire NFT trading market.

**4. How to start Lucks Trading?**

Lucks Trading is an innovative trading model that combines CrowdFunding & Lottery Draw. 

For example, a seller sells an NFT through crowdfunding for 10BNB, divides it into 1,000 shares, and the unit price is 0.01BNB. All users can participate at the price of 0.01BNB, and if you buy 1 share, you will get 1 ticket. When the crowdfunding target is reached, OpenLuck will automatically and fairly draw a lucky number, the winner who holds the lucky number will get the NFT, and the seller will get the crowdfunding amount.

**5. How is the winner of the Lucks Trading selected?**

OpenLuck is a non-custodial NFT marketplace controlled by smart contracts running on BNB Chain. The selection of lucky numbers uses ChainLink's VRF service, which is open, transparent, and truly random, ensuring the fairness and decentralization of the gameplay. Decentralization is the continuous pursuit of OpenLuck.
