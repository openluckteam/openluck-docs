Lucks Trading is an innovative trading model that combines CrowdFunding & Lottery Draw.


For example, a seller sells a NFT through crowdfunding at a price of 10BNB, divides it into 1,000 shares, and the unit price is 0.01BNB. All users can participate at the price of 0.01BNB, and if you buy 1 share, you will get 1 ticket. When the crowdfunding target is reached, OpenLuck will automatically and fairly draw a lucky number, the winner who holds the lucky number will get the NFT, and the seller will get the crowdfunding amount.


By using the world's first Lucks Trading model, it lowers the barriers to participate, which is more friendly for users. Users only need to pay for an extremely low cost on BNB Chain then can have the opportunity to win the valuable NFTs on Ethereum and BNB Chain.
