### **Groups**
Lucks Trading supports team mode, up to 10 people. If someone in the group is the winner, the group members can share the Bonus dividend equally. It greatly increases social fun and the winning probability.

Here is more detail:
1. Everyone can only be in one Group (Join or Create) in earch **Luck**
2. Only users who have joined to purchased tickets can participate in the Group
3. The bonus for the winner comes from a part of target amount (set by seller when creating). If the winner had joined in a group, all the group members can share the bonus equally.
