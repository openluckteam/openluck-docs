Lucks NFT is an innovative trading model that combines CrowdFunding & Lottery Draw.


- For example, the seller create a  crowdfunding task to sell a NFT at the price of 10BNB, and divided into 1000 tickets, and the ticket price is 0.01BNB. 

- Buyers can participate in with only one ticket. One ticket means 1/1000 chance to win a Lucks.

- When the goal of crowdfunding is achieved, OpenLuck will automatically and fairly draw a lucky number(via ChainLink VRF & ChainLink Keepers services). The winner will get NFT and the seller will get the amount of Funds

- Whatâ€™s more, the winner will get 0~30% share of the Funds (Set by Seller)
